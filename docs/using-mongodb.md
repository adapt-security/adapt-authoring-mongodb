# Using MongoDB
The `adapt-authoring-mongodb` module adds the ability to work with MongoDB databases.

## Installing MongoDB
To save data with the authoring tool, you'll need either a local MongoDB install, or a hosted solution.

If you're new to hosting web applications/MongoDB and are intending to make your install accessible via the internet, we'd suggest going with a hosted solution.

For instructions on installing MongoDB, see the [MongoDB docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#mongodb-community-edition-installation-tutorials).

## Using the module
The `adapt-authoring-mongodb` module uses MongoDB's [Node.js driver](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.3/) behind-the-scenes for communicating with MongoDB, so it's a good idea to have a basic knowledge of how this works. The [Quick Start](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html) page in the is a good place to start.

### Querying the database
The module uses `DataStorageQuery`.
